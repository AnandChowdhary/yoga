Yoga is an iOS app which finds data from HealthKit and sends it to your webhook for storage and analyics, written in React Native.

For me, it powers [Life Data](https://github.com/AnandChowdhary/life-data) where I store health data like heart rate and daily step count.

## ‚≠ê Features

- Fetch multiple datapoints from HealthKit
- Send JSON data to any webhook
- Runs in the background, once every day
